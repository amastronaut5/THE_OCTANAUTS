# 🌊 AI-Driven Unified Data Platform for Oceanographic, Fisheries & Molecular Biodiversity Insights

🚀 *Team Octanauts – Smart India Hackathon 2025 Submission*

---

## 📖 Overview
India’s marine ecosystem is rich but data on *oceanography, fisheries, and molecular biodiversity* is fragmented across silos.  
Researchers spend *40–60% of their time* on cleaning and formatting data instead of doing real science.  

This project proposes an *AI-driven unified platform* that integrates heterogeneous datasets, applies advanced ML models, and provides *actionable insights* for scientists, policymakers, and conservationists.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🔗 *Integrated Data Hub* – Brings together oceanographic, fisheries, otolith images, and DNA/eDNA datasets.  
- ⚙ *Automated ETL Pipelines* – Python + Apache Airflow with Darwin Core metadata tagging.  
- 🗄 *Smart Storage* – PostgreSQL/PostGIS for structured data + pgvector for semantic search.  
- 🧠 *AI Modules* –  
  - DNABERT + BLAST for DNA/eDNA species classification  
  - CNN (Transfer Learning) for Otolith image analysis  
  - LSTM/XGBoost for species abundance & anomaly detection  
- 📊 *Interactive Dashboards* – React + Plotly + Leaflet maps for real-time visualization.  
- 🔌 *APIs & Services* – FastAPI microservices + Natural Language Query Assistant.

## 🏗 System Architecture
- 🌊 Sources → Oceanography, Fisheries, DNA/eDNA, Otolith images  
- ⚙ ETL → Python + Airflow pipelines  
- 🗂 Standardizer → Darwin Core, FASTA, JSON Schema  
- 🗄 Database → PostgreSQL/PostGIS + Vector DB  
- 🧠 AI Engine → DNABERT, CNN, LSTM/XGBoost  
- 📊 User Layer → Dashboards, APIs, Reports

## 🎯 Why It Matters
- ⏱ *70% faster data preparation* (months → hours).  
- 📈 *3x acceleration in biodiversity studies*.  
- 💰 *₹50–100 Cr annual savings* by reducing redundant surveys.  
- 🌱 *30–40% faster detection of invasive species* via eDNA.  
- 👥 Supports *9M+ fisherfolk & coastal communities*.
